<h1>Welcome to Vanno's Portfolio
</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Advent Pro;"> My name is Vandara Tun, I also go by the name Vanno. This portfolio shows all the  programing I've done
            in CSC160 <br> Computer
            Programing Course at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island.</a>
            I created this webpage by using the programing language HTML. To give the buttons some style I used CSS and pixlr to make this web 
            page look more appeling. First I used Pixlr where I created my own custom buttons as you can see as the tabs to other webpages of this web site
           . To keep it from looking basic I made the button tabs oval shaped and added special effects to them. Then I implement them through html 
            . Lastly I spaced the tabs to be aligned with my banner also created from Pixlr with the use of CSS. You can also check out the javascript I have written at the top of this 
            web page. Also check out the apps I created. If you want to know more about me click on the about me tab above. </p>
